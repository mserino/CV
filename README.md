==========

I'm a junior web developer, I love to *make* things, not only websites, but also actual things like scarves, bracelets, necklaces, everything that gives me the opportunity to *create*.
I'm very passionate about technology, and the web in particular.
I always try to be happy and positive, and push myself to the limits.

##Web Development
When I was 13 years old I taught myself how to use HTML and CSS, and in the following years I learned how to use Adobe suite.
