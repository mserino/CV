## About me
I am a Frontend developer, very passionate about all kind of technologies and coding, in particular of Frontend techs like Javascript, HTML and CSS. I like developing clean and good looking web pages, I think that the usability and appearance of a website is as important as its functionality. I like studying user experience psychology and apply it on the work I do. I always try to deliver clean, readable and tested code.  
When I was a teenager I taught myself how to use HTML and CSS, and in the following years I learned how to use the Adobe suite (Photoshop in particular). I got my bachelor degree in Asian studies (Chinese language as a major), and started working in a university publishing company in Italy, but then I realised that I still wanted to learn how to code, and in May '14 I moved to London and joined [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com), a 12-weeks programme that teaches people how to code. It changed my life. I now work as a Frontend Developer for Deloitte Digital, in London.  
Other than coding, I love books, science fiction and fantasy in particular, but I'm starting to be interested in non-fiction books about personal development. I have a weird passion for everything that concerns Space (especially the International Space Station) and I love animals, dogs and ducks in particular.  
I am a people person, I like making friends and helping others whenever I can. At my current workplace, I've been nominated the "Chief Social Officer", because I like organising socials and feel good in aggregating people, including everyone in the circle and making friends. The only person I am competitive with is myself, but I think that failure doesn't exist, we are all here to learn as much as we can.  
I still think that I could be an astronaut, if only I were a couple of centimeters taller.
