## About me
I am a Frontend developer, very passionate about all kind of technologies and coding, in particular of Frontend techs like Javascript, HTML and CSS. I like developing clean and good looking web pages, I think that the usability and appearance of a website is as important as its functionality. I always try to deliver clean, readable and tested code, but most of all I have a constant need to learn new things and widen my knowledge.  
When I was a teenager I taught myself how to use HTML, CSS and the Adobe suite. I got my bachelor degree in Asian studies (Chinese language as a major), and started working in a university publishing company in Italy, but then I realised that I wanted to learn how to code properly, and in May '14 I moved to London and joined [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com), a 12-weeks programme to learn how to code.  
I also love books, I am fairly passionate about football and some scientific fields like astronomy, and I love dogs more than anything else.  
I am a people person, I like making friends and helping others whenever I can. The only person I am competitive with is myself, but I think that failure doesn't exist, we are all here to learn as much as we can.  
I still think that I could be an astronaut, if only I were a couple of centimeters taller.
